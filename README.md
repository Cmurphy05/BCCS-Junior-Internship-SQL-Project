Ty is very intelligent but he has a macbook and that is a big problem, especially because he cannot download git without clearing space that he for some reason does not have.

Ty has a macbook :( which is really bad, although I would like one. He cannot function properly in sqlite as he does not have the latest version as I do, so he cannot create a box like I do so all of his data looks bad and gross :(
